    <h2>Strivestaurant</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Change NavBar component in a class-based one; create a constructor and 
        log a message in the console as the component starts to render.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transform DishComments class component in a functional one.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the ReservationForm component change the rendering method, returning
        the Alert when necessary or the Form otherwise with an if/else
        statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the DishDetail component change the short-circuit operator with a
        ternary operator; insert also a setTimeout function in the
        componentDidMount method to delay the setState by 1 sec.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the DishComments component, change the current conditional rendering 
        method with a ternary operator.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the SingleDish component insert an if/else statement, checking the 
        existence of the dish prop and rendering an error
        message when not present.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Menu component, display a "Work in progress" message when the
        dishes array is empty. Use the short-circuit operator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Easter Egg time! Insert a new voice in the top navbar with text "My
        favorite!". This label should appear only when the user in on the "Cacio
        & Pepe" details page.
      </li>
