        API INFO:

        You have a CRUD endpoint for comments on:

        https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/comments/

        This means you can GET, DELETE, POST, PUT data from there.

        The Comment structure is this:

        {
          "comment": "A good book but definitely I don't like many parts of the plot",
          "rate": 3,
          "elementId": "0316438960"
        }

        Where:
        - comment is the comment inserted by the user
        - rate is a value between 1 and 5
        - elementId is the ASIN of the book
        - use usual Authentication

        !IMPORTANT!
        Yuo can't get ALL the comments. You have to specify the ElementID / ASIN in the query:

        https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/comments/{ASIN}

        Doing so, you'll get all the comments for a specific book
